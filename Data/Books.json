They help you manage memory and process strings more easily. They provide containers and other data structures that go well beyond what the standard library offers. They make it easy to build platform-independent network applications. Simply put, these 72 libraries greatly expand your C++ toolbox. The second edition contains more than 430 examples. All examples are as short as possible, but they are complete, so you can compile and run them as is. They show you what the Boost libraries offer and give you a head start on using the libraries in your own applications. The goal of this book is to increase your efficiency as a C++ developer and to simplify software development with C++. The Boost libraries introduced in this book will help you write less code with fewer bugs and finish projects faster. You code will be more concise and self-explanatory and more easily adapted when requirements change. The second edition is based on the Boost libraries 1.55.0 and 1.56.0 with the latter version having been released in August 2014. The examples are based on C++11 and have been tested with Visual Studio 2013, GCC 4.8 and Clang 3.3 on various platforms. For Boost libraries which were incorporated into the C++11 standard library, differences between Boost and the standard library are highlighted. The Boost libraries are one of the most important and influential open source C++ libraries. Their source code is available under a permissive free software license. Several Boost libraries have been incorporated into the C++11 standard library. The Boost libraries are developed and supported by the Boost community - a worldwide developer community with a strong interest in pushing C++ boundaries further.","readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":570,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.1.1.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2jUVBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2jUVBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2jUVBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=cplusplus&hl=&as_brr=5&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=9&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2jUVBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2jUVBQAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"IN","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":0,"currencyCode":"INR"},"retailPrice":{"amount":0,"currencyCode":"INR"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2jUVBQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-2jUVBQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api"},"accessInfo":{"country":"IN","viewability":"ALL_PAGES","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2jUVBQAAQBAJ&hl=&as_brr=5&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"The goal of this book is to increase your efficiency as a C++ developer and to simplify software development with C++.

Moderators of the on-line C++ FAQ at comp.lang.c++, Marshall Cline, Greg Lomow, and Mike Girou are familiar with C++ programmers' most pressing concerns. In this book, the authors concentrate on those issues most critical to the professional programmer's work, and they present more explanatory material and examples than is possible on-line. This book focuses on the effective use of C++, helping programmers avoid combining seemingly legal C++ constructs in incompatible ways. This second edition is completely up-to-date with the final ANSI/ISO C++ Standard. It covers some of the smaller syntax changes, such as \"mutable\"; more significant changes, such as RTTI and namespaces; and such major innovations as the C++ Standard Library, including the STL. In addition, this book discusses technologies such as Java, CORBA, COM/COM+, and ActiveX—and the relationship all of these have with C++. These new features and technologies are iconed to help you quickly find what is new and different in this edition. Each question-and-answer section contains an overview of the problem and solution, fuller explanations of concepts, directions for proper use of language features, guidelines for best practices and practices to avoid, and plenty of working, stand-alone examples.

It is the only book that teaches the strategies of C++ API development, including interface design, versioning, scripting, and plug-in extensibility. Drawing from the author's experience on large scale, collaborative software projects, the text offers practical techniques of API design that produce robust code for the long term. It presents patterns and practices that provide real value to individual developers as well as organizations. API Design for C++ explores often overlooked issues, both technical and non-technical, contributing to successful design decisions that product high quality, robust, and long-lived APIs. It focuses on various API styles and patterns that will allow you to produce elegant and durable libraries. A discussion on testing strategies concentrates on automated API testing techniques rather than attempting to include end-user application testing techniques such as GUI testing, system testing, or manual testing.

Bjarne Stroustrup, the designer and original implementer of C++, has reorganized, extended, and completely rewritten his definitive reference and tutorial for programmers who want to use C++ most effectively. The C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition, delivers meticulous, richly explained, and integrated coverage of the entire language—its facilities, abstraction mechanisms, standard libraries, and key design techniques. Throughout, Stroustrup presents concise, “pure C++11” examples, which have been carefully crafted to clarify both usage and program design. To promote deeper understanding, the author provides extensive cross-references, both within the book and to the ISO standard. New C++11 coverage includes Support for concurrency Regular expressions, resource management pointers, random numbers, and improved containers General and uniform initialization, simplified for-statements, move semantics, and Unicode support Lambdas, general constant expressions, control over class defaults, variadic templates, template aliases, and user-defined literals Compatibility issues Topics addressed in this comprehensive book include Basic facilities: type, object, scope, storage, computation fundamentals, and more Modularity, as supported by namespaces, source files, and exception handling C++ abstraction, including classes, class hierarchies, and templates in support of a synthesis of traditional programming, object-oriented programming, and generic programming Standard Library: containers, algorithms, iterators, utilities, strings, stream I/O, locales, numerics, and more The C++ basic memory model, in depth This fourth edition makes C++11 thoroughly accessible to programmers moving from C++98 or other languages, while introducing insights and techniques that even cutting-edge C++11 programmers will find indispensable.

Like all Deitel Developer titles, they teach the best way possible: via hundreds of complete example C++ programs, with thousands of lines of downloadable C++ source code. Unlike other C++11 books, this guide teaches robust, best-practice coding practices that fully support the CERT® Coordination Center’s authoritative secure coding standards. To help you write programs that are even more secure, the Deitels also introduce C++11’s new non-deterministic random-number generation capabilities. Using all these techniques, you can write industrial-strength C+11 code that stands up to attacks from viruses, worms, and other forms of malware. Ideal for anyone who’s worked with at least one programming language before, C++11 for Programmers utilizes a proven “early objects” approach, emphasizing program clarity, software reuse, and component-oriented software construction. In addition to the core language, it will help you take advantage of the newest standard libraries and the newest language extensions. Coverage includes many new C++11 features, including smart pointers, regular expressions, shared_ptr and weak_ptr, and more. This book contains 240 complete C++11 programs (more than 15,000 lines of downloadable code). All code has been thoroughly tested on three popular industrial-strength C++11 compilers: GNU C++ 4.7, Microsoft® Visual C++® 2012, and Apple® LLVM in Xcode® 4.5.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780133439878"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0133439879"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":848,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.3.3.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aKoxjdrT8mYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aKoxjdrT8mYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aKoxjdrT8mYC&pg=PP57&dq=cplusplus&hl=&as_brr=5&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=26&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aKoxjdrT8mYC&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aKoxjdrT8mYC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"IN","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":2933.9,"currencyCode":"INR"},"retailPrice":{"amount":2933.9,"currencyCode":"INR"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aKoxjdrT8mYC&rdid=book-aKoxjdrT8mYC&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":2933900000,"currencyCode":"INR"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":2933900000,"currencyCode":"INR"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"IN","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=aKoxjdrT8mYC&hl=&as_brr=5&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Here you&#39;ll find links to the book&#39;s examples and other resources. www.deitel.com/<b>cplusplus</b>/ www.deitel.com/visualcplusplus/ www.deitel.com/codesearchengines/ www.deitel.com/programmingprojects/ Check these Resource Centers for&nbsp;..."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"zyqQp46OJkcC","etag":"PixWyyfIeXk","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/zyqQp46OJkcC","volumeInfo":{"title":"Sun Certified Web Component Developer Study Guide Exam 310-081 (EBOOK)","authors":["David Bridgewater"],"publisher":"McGraw Hill Professional","publishedDate":"2005-10-19","description":"An integrated study system based on proven instructional methodology, this book and CD package shows you not only what--but how--to study for the SCWCD exam.

Neidhardt"],"publisher":"Springer","publishedDate":"2017-08-08","description":"This book combines elementary theory from computer science with real-world challenges in global geodetic observation, based on examples from the Geodetic Observatory Wettzell, Germany. It starts with a step-by-step introduction to developing stable and safe scientific software to run successful software projects. The use of software toolboxes is another essential aspect that leads to the application of generative programming. An example is a generative network middleware that simplifies communication. One of the book’s main focuses is on explaining a potential strategy involving autonomous production cells for space geodetic techniques. The complete software design of a satellite laser ranging system is taken as an example. Such automated systems are then combined for global interaction using secure communication tunnels for remote access. The network of radio telescopes is used as a reference. Combined observatories form coordinated multi-agent systems and offer solutions for operational aspects of the Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS) with regard to “Industry 4.0”.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9783319401393"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"3319401394"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":546,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Science"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"2.2.4.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=00QwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=00QwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.co.in/books?id=00QwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=cplusplus&hl=&as_brr=5&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=28&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=00QwDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=00QwDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"IN","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":4200.8,"currencyCode":"INR"},"retailPrice":{"amount":4200.8,"currencyCode":"INR"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=00QwDwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-00QwDwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":4200800000,"currencyCode":"INR"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":4200800000,"currencyCode":"INR"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"IN","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Applied_Computer_Science_for_GGOS_Observ-sample-epub.acsm?id=00QwDwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.co.in/books/download/Applied_Computer_Science_for_GGOS_Observ-sample-pdf.acsm?id=00QwDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=00QwDwAAQBAJ&hl=&as_brr=5&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This book combines elementary theory from computer science with real-world challenges in global geodetic observation, based on examples from the Geodetic Observatory Wettzell, Germany."}}]}
